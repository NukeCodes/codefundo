Team Name: **Nuke Codes**

## The Challenge
Find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict, prevent, or manage the impact of natural disasters.

## Judging Criteria
The Judges will evaluate each criteria on a scale of 0 - 10. Take each criteria seriously.
* **Uniqueness of Solution**  
  Do we have an impressive idea and/or a better approach than the ones already out there?
* **Maximum impact to successful outcomes**  
  How many lives can our solution save in an event of an incident? How economical is it for a city to implement our solution?
* **Feasibility of Solution**  
  How practical is it to build our product? Could people in remote areas with limited or no internet connectivity use our product? 
* **Relevance to Theme**  
  Stay as close to the problem statement as possible. Our prototype should take us (and Microsoft) closer to the goal predicting natural disasters.


# Idea
Describe the solution we plan to create within 500 words. It should include the following points, but isn't limited to these:
* What are we planning to build?
* How does it work?
* How can users get started with the project?
* What dataset(s) are we using?
* What technologies are we using?
